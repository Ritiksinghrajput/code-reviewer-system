Okay, I've reviewed the code snippet:

```javascript
function sum(){ return a + b ;}
```

Here's what I've found and some suggestions:

**Issues:**

*   **Undeclared Variables:** The variables `a` and `b` are not declared within the function or passed as arguments. This will lead to errors (specifically, `ReferenceError: a is not defined` and `ReferenceError: b is not defined`) when the function is executed because JavaScript won't know what values `a` and `b` should have.
*   **Lack of Function Arguments:** The function doesn't accept any arguments.  A `sum` function is generally expected to take the numbers you want to add as inputs.
*   **Missing Semicolon (minor):** While JavaScript often handles missing semicolons with automatic semicolon insertion (ASI), it's best practice to include them for clarity and to avoid potential unexpected behavior.

**Suggestions:**

Here are a few ways to fix and improve the code, depending on the intended use case:

**1. Passing Arguments to the Function (Most Common and Recommended):**

   ```javascript
   function sum(a, b) {
       return a + b;
   }
   ```

   *   **Explanation:**
        *   The function now accepts two arguments, `a` and `b`.  These are the numbers you want to add.
        *   When you call the function, you'll provide the values for `a` and `b`: `sum(5, 3)`  // Returns 8

   *   **Benefits:**
        *   Clear, explicit, and reusable.
        *   The function's behavior is predictable based on its inputs.

**2. Using Variables from an Outer Scope (Less Common, Potentially Problematic):**

   ```javascript
   let a = 10;
   let b = 5;

   function sum() {
       return a + b;
   }
   ```

   *   **Explanation:**
        *   `a` and `b` are defined *outside* the function. The `sum` function will access these variables from the surrounding scope.

   *   **Drawbacks:**
        *   **Tight Coupling:** The `sum` function now *depends* on the variables `a` and `b` being defined in the outer scope. If they aren't defined, or if their values change unexpectedly, the function will behave incorrectly.  This makes the code harder to reason about and maintain.
        *   **Less Reusable:**  You can only use this `sum` function to add the specific values stored in the outer `a` and `b`.

**3. Prompt the user to enter value and then sum (use case : Browser Environment)**

```javascript
function sum() {
  // Prompt the user to enter two numbers
  let a = parseFloat(prompt("Enter the first number:"));
  let b = parseFloat(prompt("Enter the second number:"));

  // Check if the inputs are valid numbers
  if (isNaN(a) || isNaN(b)) {
    return "Invalid input. Please enter numbers only.";
  }

  return a + b;
}

// Example usage:
let result = sum();
console.log(result); // Output the result to the console, or display it on the webpage
```

*   **Explanation:**
    *   The function now  prompts the user to enter value and stores it in a and b variables and parseFloat is used to convert string to floating point number.
    *   The `isNaN` function is used to check the input is valid number or not .

**Recommendation:**

The **first option (passing arguments)** is almost always the best approach. It makes your function self-contained, reusable, and easier to understand.  Avoid relying on variables from outer scopes unless you have a very specific reason and understand the implications.
